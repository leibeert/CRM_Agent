## **‚ö†Ô∏è Expected Warnings (Normal)**

When you start the Flask server, you may see these warnings - **they are normal and expected**:

```
WARNING:matching.utils.embeddings:sentence-transformers not available
WARNING:matching.core.semantic_matcher:sentence-transformers not available, using fallback similarity
WARNING:matching.parsers.job_parser:spaCy not available, using basic NLP
WARNING:matching.parsers.skill_extractor:spaCy not available, using basic extraction
WARNING:matching.utils.cache:Redis not available, using in-memory cache fallback
```

**These warnings mean:**
- ‚úÖ **Your system is working correctly**
- ‚úÖ **Fallback mechanisms are active**
- ‚úÖ **All features will work** (with basic implementations)
- ‚ö° **To get advanced AI features**, you can optionally install: `pip install sentence-transformers spacy redis`
